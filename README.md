    This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,

    You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,

## What is it?

URobot is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python 3 with an SQLAlchemy database.

Based on [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot) and [ProjectBish](https://github.com/adekmaulana/ProjectBish) userbot.
I made this fork to cherry-pick some modules I needed. Eventually I started messing with the code and here we are.
